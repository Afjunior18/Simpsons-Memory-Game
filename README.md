## Bugs and Fixes

- Bug: Dynamic Board Size
Description: Initially, the game board size would shrink as pairs were matched and removed, resulting in a dynamically changing play area.

    **Resolution**: To address this, a static image representing all matched pairs was used. This ensured a consistent board size throughout the game.

- Bug: Styling Alert Messages
Description: Styling alert messages proved challenging. The decision was made to create a custom function for displaying messages with desired styles. However, a new issue arose where the win message remained visible on the board after starting a new game.

    **Resolution**: To fix this, a function was implemented to hide the win message whenever a new game was initiated, regardless of the chosen difficulty level.

- Bug: Border artifact on initial card click. When starting the first game and clicking on cards, a minor artifact appeared as a faint black border in the middle of the cards. Various attempts were made to rectify the issue.
  
    ![Black Border](docs/error-click-image.png)

    **Attempts:**
Verified image and container sizes using the Unicorn Revealer tool, a Google Chrome extension.
  
    ![Verified image properties](docs/error-click-image-unicorn.png)

    Adjusted spacing between each div on the board.
    ![Adjust image properties](docs/adjust-image.png)

    Initially applied a border-radius: 50% to each card, but observed that it exacerbated the black border issue, prompting the removal of this property.

    ![Removal border radius](docs/removal-border-radius.png)

    **Result**: While the mentioned adjustments led to a significant improvement, a slight border artifact still persisted on the initial clicks of each game. Further investigation is required for a complete resolution.
